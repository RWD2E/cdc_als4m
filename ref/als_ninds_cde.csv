The results will indicate the number of total calories expended per unit time and the RQ (respiratory quotient), which is in indication of the predominant type of substrate oxidized (fat or carbohydrate). Many equations have been developed and validated against indirect calorimetry to estimate either REE or BMR based on easy-to-measure clinical factors such as height, weight, age, sex, lean body mass, and fat mass in varying combinations.
